Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 25 December 2025

Novarex Studios ("we", "our", or "us") operates the TREX Android application (the "App").

Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using the App.

1. Information We Collect

a) Information You Provide

When you use the App, you may manually enter personal and financial information, including:
• Investment details such as asset names, amounts, dates, quantities, and notes
• Any optional information you choose to add inside the app

This data is entered by you and stored only to provide the App's functionality.

b) Account Information

When you sign in using Google, we collect your name and email address solely to:
• create and manage your account
• authenticate access
• prevent unauthorized access

We do not use this information for marketing, advertising, or profiling.

c) Permissions

The App may request notification permission solely to send app-related notifications.
No other device permissions (such as contacts, location, storage, or phone state) are accessed.

d) Financial Functionality Disclosure

The App is a manual-entry portfolio tracking and visualization tool that uses publicly available market data for valuation and display purposes.
It does not provide lending, credit, brokerage, trading, or advisory services,
and does not facilitate financial transactions of any kind.

2. Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
• Bank account details
• PAN, Aadhaar, or other government IDs
• Payment or card information
• Contacts, call logs, or messages
• Location data
• Device tracking or advertising identifiers

The App does not link to banks or initiate financial transactions.

3. How We Use Your Information

Your data is used only to:
• Display and calculate your portfolio information
• Maintain your user account
• Improve app reliability and performance

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data for advertising or marketing purposes.

4. Data Storage & Security

We store user data using Supabase, a managed backend service.

Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS. We implement reasonable
administrative and technical safeguards to protect user data.

The App is designed for non-sensitive, manually entered information.
Users are strictly advised not to store sensitive personal data such as
government-issued IDs, bank credentials, or payment information, which
the App does not request or require.

5. Data Retention & Account Deletion

• You can delete your account at any time from within the App.
• Upon deletion, your data is removed from active systems.
• Some data may remain in secure backups for up to 12 months, after which it is permanently deleted.
• This retention is solely for operational, security, and recovery purposes.

Users who no longer have access to the App may request account and data
deletion through our web-based request form at: https://forms.gle/2eZfKNBf4abce14GA.

Requests submitted through this form will be processed in accordance
with this Privacy Policy.

6. Third-Party Services

The App uses:
• Google Sign-In for authentication
• Supabase for backend services

These services process data according to their own privacy policies.

7. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
If such data is identified, it will be deleted.

8. Your Rights

You may:
• Access your data
• Correct your data
• Delete your account and associated data

All of this can be done directly within the App.

You have the right to withdraw your consent for the processing of your
personal data at any time.

Because the App's core functionality depends on processing your data,
withdrawal of consent will result in the deletion of your account and all
associated data. Withdrawal of consent can be initiated by deleting your
account within the App or by contacting us at novarexstudios@gmail.com.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Changes will be reflected in the App with an updated effective date.
